“Once in a while, I’ll see an element on a website and I can tell a human made that decision” says New York-based web designer Jon Lucas. “Even though this medium is so digital and stark and you have an LED light shining directly into your eyes, there’s still something human that can be communicated through it.”

	“You have to have a sense of humor to live with the web,” says Lucas, “It’s important to keep things light and casual and to remember, at the end of the day, this is just a piece of metal and plastic sitting on your lap.”
